Dutchess is a reality television personality, best known for being part of the television show “Black Ink Crew”. She’s also been seen as one of the newer members of the staff of one of the most popular tattoo shops in Harlem, New York. All of her endeavors have helped put her net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Dutchess Lattimore? As of mid-2016, authoritative sources inform us of a net worth that is at $400,000, mostly earned through reality television, but she also earns a significant amount of money for being a high profile tattoo artist. She’s a model too, and as she continues her career it is expected that her wealth will increase.</p><h3>Dutchess Lattimore Net Worth $400,000</h3><p>Dutchess attended North Carolina A&T where she studied Business Management and Visual Art. She graduated cum laude, and then while studying for an MBA, discovered her passion for tattoo artistry. After graduating, she decided to fully pursue a career in the field, and in a short time, she earned a reputation as a respected tattoo artist, and so decided to move to New York City to expand to a larger audience, and she was hired by the popular tattoo shop “Black Ink”. She is the only female tattoo artist employed by the company, and over time they all became part of the television series “Black Ink Crew”. The series showcases the daily lives of the shop as well as the staff. One of the more notable personalities in the show is Ceaser Emanuel who owns the tattoo parlor, but they are all seen tattooing high profile clients, and the popularity of the show has certainly propelled Lattimore’s career and net worth upwards.</p><p>Due to her popularity on the show, Dutchess was given opportunities to be featured in various tattoo publications, including Urban Ink and Inked, and now she works part time as a model aside from her work as a tattoo artist. She does runway shows, and even won the 2010 Boston Tatoo Convention Beauty Pageant. Since then, she’s received a lot of praise for both her skills and beauty.</p><p>For her personal life, it is known that Lattimore is engaged to Ceaser Emanuel after what has been an on-off relationship. Dutchess had her first tattoo when she was 15 years old – it is an ankh that is seen on her back and was done by one of her father’s friends. According to an interview, she originally did tattoo artistry as a hobby and said that there are still some racial issues in terms of treatment among tattoo artists. She continues to improve her skills to prove that she is one of the best and many of her friends believe that she is a very driven individual.</p><p>Dutchess also proves to be very popular on social media, having more than 800,000 followers on Instagram. She also has more than 1.2 million likes on her Facebook page and over 105,000 followers on Twitter. She often updates her fans of her current endeavors and displays a lot of her photoshoots online.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self readability=1><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Black Ink Crew</td><td>2013-2014</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Herself</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Big Morning Buzz Live with Nick Lachey</td><td>2013</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Herself</td></tr></table><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjp2srZuYmsC0ecuaq62hnaS%2FpnnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal7</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdutchess-lattimore-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdutchess-lattimore-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdutchess-lattimore-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdutchess-lattimore-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdutchess-lattimore-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdutchess-lattimore-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./missy-elliott-lil-wayne-custom-jacket.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./missy-elliott-lil-wayne-custom-jacket.html>Missy Elliott Gushes Over Lil Wayne As He Gifts Her Custom Jacket</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./where-does-zion-williamson-live-inside-zion-williamsons-home.html>Where does Zion Williamson live?
