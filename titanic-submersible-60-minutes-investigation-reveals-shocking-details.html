He carefully characterized Rush’s ambitious venture as a “mousetrap for billionaires,” suggesting potential safety issues and inadequate preparation.</span></p><p><span>Stanley’s genuine concern for the project’s safety was evident in his tone and demeanor during the interview.

He reported hearing loud, gunshot-like noises every three to four minutes during the underwater journey. Such disturbances, especially in the depths of the ocean, should have raised serious concerns about the craft’s safety. When Stanley attempted to voice his worries, he found himself in a heated argument with Rush.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Ignored_Warnings_and_Lack_of_Experience></span><span><strong>Ignored Warnings and Lack of Experience</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Despite Stanley’s earnest attempts to address the issue, Rush seemingly dismissed the concerns about the carbon-fiber hull and did not possess sufficient experience in operating submersibles. Stanley even went so far as to vividly depict the potential wreckage of the submersible at the ocean’s bottom to emphasize the gravity of the situation.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_Troubling_Maritime_Culture></span><span><strong>A Troubling Maritime Culture</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>The investigation also highlighted the disturbing culture surrounding safety within the maritime community. Rob McCallum, who led a Titanic submersible expedition in the past, revealed that those who raised safety concerns were not only ignored but silenced. He emphasized the toxic nature of such a culture and its dire implications for the safety of those involved.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Rushs_Alleged_Death_Wish></span><span><strong>Rush’s Alleged Death Wish</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Adding another layer of concern, Stanley expressed his belief that Rush may have had a death wish and was willing to jeopardize his life and the lives of his customers for the sake of making history. This revelation paints a troubling picture of the motivations behind the ill-fated journey.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Co-founders_Defense></span><span><strong>Co-founder’s Defense</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>In contrast to the accusations, Guillermo Söhnlein, the co-founder of Occeangate, appeared in the interview and characterized Rush as “risk-averse,” attempting to defend their business decisions.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_Legacy_of_Tragedy_and_Lessons></span><span><strong>A Legacy of Tragedy and Lessons</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>The <strong>Titanic Submersible 60 minutes</strong> tragedy has left an indelible mark on the maritime community, with shocking revelations and haunting questions about the safety and preparation of such ventures.
