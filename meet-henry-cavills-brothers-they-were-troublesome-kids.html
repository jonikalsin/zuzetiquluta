<time>03 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Henry Cavill is a British actor best known for portraying “Superman” in DC’s extended universe. He is also known for playing Sherlock Holmes in the Netflix film “Enola Holmes” and its sequel.</p><p>The beloved actor was born in St Helier, the capital of channel island Jersey, on May 5, 1983. Since his first significant role in the 2001 film “Laguna,” Henry has been featured in over 30 projects.&nbsp;Given his stellar record, it is no wonder Henry has won the hearts of his fans, who are always curious to know more about him.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/heen.jpg><p>They are even more interested in his personal life because he keeps it mostly private. This time, our focus will be on Henry Cavill’s brothers and the bond between them.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Henry_Cavills_Brothers_Background></span>Henry Cavill’s Brothers’ Background<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The five brothers were born to Marianne and Colin Richard Cavill and were raised in Jersey and UK territory off the coast of France.&nbsp;Henry once told Kelly Ripa that his mother had been excellent. According to him, she raised him and his brothers “strong and tough, but with a lot of love.”&nbsp;</p><p>He <a href=#>said</a> of his siblings: “Amazingly, none of us gave each other stitches. But I am the only one who did not come close to death at some stage as a child.”</p><p>Henry and his brothers got up to so much mischief that his mother once changed their wallpaper to one that could easily be cleaned in case of blood splatters.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/herb.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Are_Henry_Cavills_Brothers></span>Who Are Henry Cavill’s Brothers?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Henry Cavill is one of five brothers. Yes, there are four other variable versions of him with similarly dashing features in this universe.&nbsp;Among his siblings, Henry is among the only two to make a name in the acting industry. However, the other Cavill brothers also have exciting and fulfilling careers.</p><p>Over the years, their famous actor has been candid about his bond with his brothers. He has discussed his relationship with them, sharing details from their younger years of rough plays to their mature years as established men.</p><p>Meet them.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cavv.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Piers_Cavill></span>Piers Cavill&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Henry Cavill’s oldest brother is very private, so little is known about him except that he was a former army officer. Henry was intelligent and knew not to bother his older brothers, as little brothers usually would. During a “Jimmy Kimmel Live” interview, the “Superman” star gave an overview of his older siblings.&nbsp;</p><p>He said, “The eldest gets the toughest game. They get all the discipline. By the time it gets to us, it’s all just a free for all.”</p><p>Henry also revealed in the interview that even though he was about the same size as his brothers, he was more intelligent.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Niki_Cavill></span>Niki Cavill<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Henry’s second oldest brother is Lieutenant Colonel Niki Cavill.&nbsp;</p><p>The Cavill family’s involvement in the military can be traced back several decades. Piers and Niki served in the military, and Henry’s father had reportedly served in the Navy.</p><p>Niki was active in Afghanistan before receiving his MBE in 2012. He was described as “A courageous field soldier” by the BBC.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Simon_Cavill></span>Simon Cavill<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>He is Henry’s third older brother. While appearing on “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” Henry poked fun at Simon Cavill, saying:&nbsp;</p><p>“My eldest brother, one up, was four years older than me. He was considerably larger and incredibly strong. He was so strong that we would make fun of him and say ‘Hulk smash.'”</p><p>Unlike Henry, Simon chose a career in the business world. Simon is married to a woman named Victoria Cavill and has a job in finance.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple <a href=#>tied the knot</a> in 2014 when Henry’s career peaked.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Charlie_Cavill></span>Charlie Cavill&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Henry Cavill’s younger brother is the most well-known among his other brothers.&nbsp;This is mainly because Charlie is an actor like Henry. Charlie’s IMDb profile shows he is two years younger than Henry.</p><p>Outside of movies, Charlie also seems to have some business dealings. He founded an upscale candle business with his wife, Heather. Their website talks more about their services and contains some interesting trivia about him.</p><p>For example, it says he spent 11 years working in the entertainment sector, loves Halloween, and is a big fan of drinks. Charlie seems to have retired early from acting and is focusing on running the business with his soul mate.</p><p>Other movie stars like Charlie, who decided on an early retirement, include <a href=#>Cameron Diaz</a>, Mara Wilson, and Shirley Temple.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuqax02afnqairnqkrdWio6WrXZe%2FsMDHnqmsZaSdsrp51p6pnmWkp7y2rsueqqillWK4qrDSaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmeet-henry-cavills-brothers-they-were-troublesome-kids.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmeet-henry-cavills-brothers-they-were-troublesome-kids.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmeet-henry-cavills-brothers-they-were-troublesome-kids.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmeet-henry-cavills-brothers-they-were-troublesome-kids.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmeet-henry-cavills-brothers-they-were-troublesome-kids.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmeet-henry-cavills-brothers-they-were-troublesome-kids.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./dennis-holahan.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./dennis-holahan.html>Who is Dennis Holahan dating?
