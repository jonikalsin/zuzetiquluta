<time>26 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Birdie Thwaites</strong> is a rising star.&nbsp; <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Brenton Thwaites</a> and <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Chloe Pacey’s</a> oldest daughter. Brenton, her father, is a well-known actor who has appeared in films such as The Giver and Titans.</p><h2>Birdie Thwaites Age & Biography</h2><p><strong>She was born in Australia in March 2016 and is currently 7 years old in 2023.</strong> She is of Australian nationality and has English and French ancestors. Brenton, her father, was born in Cairns, Queensland, and Chloe is from Perth. Brenton was born on August 10, 1989, and Chloe was born on October 3, 1989.</p><p>Birdie has not yet begun attending an educational institute; however, she is now six years old, which means she will almost certainly enroll this year unless her parents intend to homeschool her.</p><h2>Who Is Biridie Thwaites’ Father?</h2><p><strong><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Brenton</a>, on the other hand, requires no introduction</strong>. After all, the Australian actor has already made a name for himself in the entertainment industry.</p><p>He made his acting debut in the independent film Charge Over You in 2010. During his time in the Australian entertainment industry, he appeared in a number of films and television shows, including Home and Away and Slide.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Brenton-1.jpg alt="Birdie Thwaites Age" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He worked in several hit films after moving to the United States, including Blue Lagoon: The Awakening, Oculus, The Giver, and Gods of Egypt. In addition, he portrayed Nightwing in the HBO series Titans.</p><h2>Who Is Birdie’s Mother?</h2><p>When it comes to her mother, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Chloe</a>, she is a naturopath student and artist based in Australia. She has posted numerous photos of her artwork on her personal Instagram account. She appears to enjoy abstract photography.</p><p>Aside from that, Chloe strongly supports open breastfeeding. Chloe revealed in 2016 that she had been approached several times to cover her breasts while breastfeeding her daughter Birdie. Furthermore, the people who told her about the cover-up were women.</p><h2>Birdie Thwaites Siblings</h2><p><strong>She has two younger siblings in addition to herself</strong>. To begin with, a few years after Birdie’s birth, her mother gave birth to another girl, whom they named Peppa. She is only two years Birdie’s junior.</p><p>Brenton and Chloe’s family of four will grow to five when their third child is born in September 2020. The couple has yet to reveal the gender of their youngest child.</p><h2>Her Parents’ Relationship: Are They Married?</h2><p><strong>Brenton and Chloe first met in early 2015 in Australia while the actor was filming Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.</strong></p><p>Brenton, despite having his primary residence in Los Angeles, spent some time in his home country at the time. And, as fate would have it, Chloe was his roommate. The two hit it off right away. They made their first public appearance as a couple in November 2015, at the premiere of In the Heart of the Sea.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Brento-1.jpg alt="Birdie Thwaites Parents" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>This is probably the most frequently asked question about Birdie’s parents. Brenton and Chloe have been dating for several years, but we haven’t heard anything about them taking their relationship any further.</p><p>Furthermore, the couple has yet to tie the knot. They don’t appear to be interested in taking the relationship to the next level. Although we believe that a relationship does not require any documentation to prove its worth, it is natural for fans to be curious about where their love story is going.</p><h2>Birdie Thwaites’s Net Worth</h2><p><strong>Brenton, her father, is one of the best actors around, and it would be an understatement to say he makes a good living from his profession.</strong> According to online sources, Brenton has an estimated net worth of $8 million as of September 2023.</p><p>Her life is undoubtedly good because her father is a millionaire. Furthermore, the Thwaites family used to live in a 734-square-meter block on Albany Avenue that her father purchased for $1.07 million.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiZoqqUnrJuwMewmKKslah6orjLZpibp6WpeqO%2BxKerqKZdqbW4rcitnKxlk525sLGMqZicnamoeqWt1KCfrZ2iZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbirdie-thwaites-all-about-brenton-thwaites-chloe-paceys-daughter.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbirdie-thwaites-all-about-brenton-thwaites-chloe-paceys-daughter.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbirdie-thwaites-all-about-brenton-thwaites-chloe-paceys-daughter.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbirdie-thwaites-all-about-brenton-thwaites-chloe-paceys-daughter.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbirdie-thwaites-all-about-brenton-thwaites-chloe-paceys-daughter.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbirdie-thwaites-all-about-brenton-thwaites-chloe-paceys-daughter.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./is-jisoo-gay-what-is-her-sexuality.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./is-jisoo-gay-what-is-her-sexuality.html>Is Jisoo Gay What Is Her Sexuality?
