Source: Instagram</p><h2><span id=Mikey_Tua_8211_Professional_Life>Mikey Tua – Professional Life</span></h2><p>Following in his brother Jojo’s footsteps, Mikey too ventured into the world of acting. He made his big-screen debut with Jay Gerren’s directorial venture ‘<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Try to Smile</a>’ in 2018. Also starring Sébastien Charmant, Erica Denise Curry, and Katy Duncan, the film tells the story of a professional African American woman trying to fight off a curse that has been passed down in her family. Tua portrays a character named Austin.</p><p>He then appeared in the short film ‘Coma’. Directed by Su Chen, the film revolves around three grieving strangers who come together on one gloomy day in Los Angeles. He also co-starred with Danielle Cohn, his girlfriend, in the music video for her song ‘Only You’.</p><p>Tua created his YouTube channel on February 5, 2015, and posted the first video in June 2018. He is not particularly active on the platform, having uploaded less than ten videos since the inception of the channel.

They had known each other for quite some time before they started dating. When they met, Cohn was already in a relationship, so Tua kept his distance. It was only after she and her previous boyfriend parted ways that they began dating.</p><p>Cohn has stated that she admires Tua’s kindness. He once even saved her life. It occurred on Tua’s birthday in 2018. They were traveling in a car together. He was sitting right behind the driver whereas Cohn was sitting in the middle seat. She had the seat belt tied around her waist.</p><p>They were in a car accident and the back of the car subsequently lifted, throwing Cohn forward. She blacked out soon after the accident occurred but Tua never did. He put his arm around her and pulled her back, preventing her from smashing into the windscreen.</p><p>Soon, they were taken to a hospital where it was discovered that her collarbone was broken and that she needed immediate surgery. Tua, on the other hand, escaped with minor injuries. As of now, the duo is enjoying their time and having a great time together.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-43254 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Mikey-Tua-gf.jpg alt="Mikey Tua" width=650 height=763 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-43254 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Mikey Tua and his girlfriend, Danielle Cohn clicking a photo.
