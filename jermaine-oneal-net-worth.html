He began his career in the NBA straight out of high school, being selected by the Portland Trail Blazers at just 17 years old. At 18, he became the youngest player to ever play in an NBA game.</p><p>O’Neal played for various teams throughout his career, including the Indiana Pacers, Miami Heat, Boston Celtics, Toronto Raptors, Golden State Warriors, and Phoenix Suns. However, he found the most success with the Pacers, helping them reach the NBA Playoffs six times and setting numerous franchise records. His accomplishments include being selected to six NBA All-Star teams, receiving the NBA Magic Johnson Award, and earning the NBA Most Improved Player award.</p><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_High_School_Career>Early Life and High School Career</span></h2><p>Jermaine O’Neal was born on October 13th, 1978 in Columbia, South Carolina. At an early age, he showed promise in athletics, particularly basketball. He was inspired by players like Bill Russell and grew quickly, reaching 6 foot 4 by the age of 14.</p><p>However, at the age of 16, O’Neal faced controversy when he was considered for rape charges involving his 15-year-old girlfriend. Although charges were dropped, it affected his on-court performance. Coach George Glymph stepped in to introduce structure into his life.</p><p>O’Neal’s senior high school season was his best, averaging 22.4 points per game and receiving numerous honors. Despite poor SAT scores, Coach Glymph recommended he go straight into the NBA, following the example of Kevin Garnett a year prior.</p><h2><span id=Jermaine_ONeals_NBA_Career>Jermaine O’Neal’s NBA Career</span></h2><p>Jermaine O’Neal entered the NBA draft in 1996 and was selected by the Portland Trail Blazers. He missed the first 17 games due to a bone contusion in his knee and made his debut just after turning 18, becoming the youngest player to play in an NBA game. However, he struggled to get playing time and doubted his decision to skip college.</p><p>In the 1998-1999 season, O’Neal was traded to the Indiana Pacers, where he achieved some of the most impressive achievements of his career, including his first All-Star selections and an Eastern Conference Final. However, he was also involved in controversy when he punched a fan who had invaded the court, resulting in a 25-game suspension.</p><p>After playing for several other teams, O’Neal signed with the Golden State Warriors in 2013 but was sidelined by wrist surgery in 2014 and retired in 2016.</p><h2><span id=Jermaine_ONeals_NBA_Salary>Jermaine O’Neal’s NBA Salary</span></h2><p>Jermaine O’Neal once had a salary of $23 million per year, making him the second-highest-paid player in the NBA after Kobe Bryant. His most recent contract with the Pacers was a seven-year, $126-million deal. Throughout his career, O’Neal earned a total of $168 million in salary.</p><h2><span id=Jermaine_ONeals_Real_Estate_Ventures>Jermaine O’Neal’s Real Estate Ventures</span></h2><p>In 2011, O’Neal put his Nevada mansion on the market for $3.5 million, which he originally purchased for the same price in 2007. The 7,600 square foot home includes a movie theater, marble baths, an indoor basketball court, and a wine room.</p><p>In 2013, a home in Carmel, Indiana once owned by O’Neal was listed for just under $3 million. The property boasts almost 12,000 square feet of living space, six bedrooms, a lighted tennis court, infinity pool, and two three-car garages.</p><p>In 2019, O’Neal attempted to sell his Southlake, Texas home, which had previously been listed for around $11 million. The 16,500 square foot residence sits on almost 5 acres of land and includes eight bedrooms, a game room, gym, bowling alley, theater, and indoor basketball court. The property also features a large pool, outdoor kitchen, and golf green, as well as an elevator and six-car garage. After multiple unsuccessful attempts to sell, O’Neal sent the property to auction with no reserve.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunC2xKukmqGemnqwusSao2amlal6uLvRrZ9o</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjermaine-oneal-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjermaine-oneal-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjermaine-oneal-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjermaine-oneal-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjermaine-oneal-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjermaine-oneal-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jimmy-horn-jr-parents-religion.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jimmy-horn-jr-parents-religion.html>Jimmy Horn Jr Parents: Who Are They?
