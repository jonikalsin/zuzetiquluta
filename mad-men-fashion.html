While wars raged and political parties fragmented, 1960s fashion soared through a golden age. Rising wages increased demand for clothing and high fashion — and the “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mad Men</a>” and women who donned them while drinking and smoking at work are a testament to that:</p><img alt="Mad Men Fashion Jackie Kennedy" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Mad-Men-fashion-Jackie-Kennedy.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body>The decade’s first fashion icon was first lady Jackie Kennedy.
