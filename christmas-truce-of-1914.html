It was a day for peace – if only fleeting.</p><p>On the night before Christmas, Captain Arthur O’Sullivan of the British army’s Royal Irish Rifles was stationed in Rue du Bois, France. He heard a German accent float from across the barracks. It said, “Do not shoot after 12 o’clock and we will not do so either.” Then, “If you English come out and talk to us, we won’t fire.”</p><p>One Irish rifleman ventured out of his trench to test the invitation. After arriving back safely with a German cigar as a gift, others made their way onto the still battlefield. No Man’s Land filled with soldiers meeting each other halfway.</p><p>And so began the unofficial Christmas Truce of 1914.</p><h2>The Christmas Truce Of 1914: A Welcome Respite To Weary Soldiers</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-142313 alt="The Christmas Truce Illustration" width=900 height=540 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Illustrated-truce.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-142313 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>An artist’s impression of the Christmas Truce of 1914 from The Illustrated London News: “British and German Soldiers Arm-in-Arm Exchanging Headgear: A Christmas Truce between Opposing Trenches”.</span></p><p>By December 1914, trench warfare was in full swing and already there were some 405,000 casualties.</p><p>Earlier that month, Pope Benedict XV suggested a temporary hiatus for the holiday, but the warring countries refused to create an official cease-fire — so the soldiers took it upon themselves to lay down their arms.</p><p>The Christmas truce also provided the armies with time to collect their deceased soldiers from the fields and bury them. This gesture meant a lot in terms of respect for the dead for both sides.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-145990 alt="World War 1 Christmas Truce" width=900 height=584 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/christmas-truce-soccer.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-145990 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Universal History Archive/UIG/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Photograph of soldiers playing football in No Man’s Land during the Christmas truce.</span></p><p>And so, along the front lines in France and Belgium on Christmas eve, soldiers heard carols in the distance. German troops sang “Stille Nacht, Heilige Nacht” (“Silent Night, Holy Night”) and the Allied troops chimed in – singing in alternating languages.</p><p>Cautiously, more soldiers began to join in on the celebrations. Germans held up lanterns and called to the British, assuring them in broken English that they wouldn’t shoot. Instead, they wished them a Merry Christmas. Men from both sides intermingled, shook hands, and shared cigarettes and food.</p><p>In the words of Captain Robert Miles of the King’s Shropshire Light Infantry:</p><p>We are having the most extraordinary Christmas Day imaginable. A sort of unarranged and quite unauthorized but perfectly understood and scrupulously observed truce exists between us and our friends in front. The funny thing is it only seems to exist in this part of the battle line – on our right and left we can all hear them firing away as cheerfully as ever.</p><a href=#><img decoding=async alt="Christmas Truce Of 1914" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img//thumb/300.allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/the-christmas-truce-of-1914-cover.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> History Uncovered Podcast Episode 14: The World War I Christmas Truce Of 1914 In the midst of the unrelenting violence of World War I, a ceasefire suddenly swept across areas of the Western front in 1914. Massive amounts of life had already been extinguished, but there was one event that halted the brutality and bloodshed.</a><p>Some even say that soccer games broke out during the truce.</p><p>Historian Alan Wakefield <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>, “If it happened — and there are very few collaborative accounts — there’s second, third-hand accounts of somebody hearing of a game going on somewhere.” However, if you’re keeping score, those who heard about it happening said the game ended three to two for the Germans.</p><p>Indeed, historians remain skeptical, but widespread accounts do exist, with some saying that a game broke out between British and German forces near Ypres, Belgium, while others are said to have faced off in a match near Le Tourquet, France. And though such accounts may remain unproven, the mythology of impromptu soccer matches remains an essential part of the mythology surrounding the Christmas Truce of 1914 to this day.</p><h2>The Legacy Of The World War I Christmas Truce</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-308038 alt="Soldiers Play Soccer" width=900 height=675 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/soldiers-play-soccer.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-308038 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Historians claim there are no primary sources to confirm whether or not a friendly soccer match took place during the truce, but many soldiers wrote home about a match they heard about from someone else.</span></p><p>Many generals and senior officers were not on board with this overall show of goodwill. In some areas, peace lasted until the first few days of 1915 without many shots fired. The military made it clear that this was not acceptable wartime behavior. Another holiday truce of this kind was never recorded.</p><p>Fighting did still occur on Christmas in some areas. Corporal Clifford Lane of H Company Hertfordshire regiment explains that upon seeing some Germans emerge from the trenches with lanterns, he was ordered to open fire.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-142311 alt="World War I Christmas Truce Memorial" width=800 height=650 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/cross-memorialized.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-142311 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>A cross, left in Comines-Warneton in Belgium in 1999 to celebrate the site of the Christmas Truce.</span></p><p>“The Germans did not reply to our fire and carried on with their celebrations.” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Corporal Lane remembered</a>. “They ignored us and were having a very fine time indeed and we continued in our wet trenches trying to make the most of it.”</p><p>He later regretted not engaging in the truce with the Germans. “It would have been a good experience,” he said.</p><p>But back in 1914, things magically aligned to allow for some holiday spirit. The soldiers involved in the Great War were either green newcomers or weathered veterans. They’d expected the fighting to be short and done by Christmas. The war wasn’t too “dirty”; the propaganda machine hadn’t churned up the seething hatred against sides.</p><p>Indeed, though attempts were made to enact holiday truces in 1915 and 1916, the war had grown so bitter by then that any cease-fires were short-lived at best.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-308031 alt="Soldiers Pose In No Man's Land" width=900 height=630 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/soldiers-pose-in-no-mans-land.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-308031 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Imperial War Museum</span><span class=caption-body>British and German soldiers pose in No Man’s Land, unoccupied territory.</span></p><p>Today, the Christmas Truce of 1914 is attributed to the last of the romanticized, “gentlemanly” soldiers of the era. These men confronted their enemies face to face. Military strategies may have certainly changed, but it’s comforting to know that on one frosty Christmas morning, adversaries laid down their arms. That they extended hands in a gesture of peace; however temporary it may be.</p><p>After learning about the World War I Christmas Truce of 1914, check out these <a href=#>weird Christmas ads from our past.</a> Then read about <a href=#>the heartwarming story behind the first ever Rockefeller Center Christmas tree</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyktNGiqq2lkah6tb7UnJxmp5Zifnp9kw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchristmas-truce-of-1914.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fchristmas-truce-of-1914.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fchristmas-truce-of-1914.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fchristmas-truce-of-1914.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchristmas-truce-of-1914.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchristmas-truce-of-1914.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./alec-benjamin-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./alec-benjamin-net-worth.html>Alec Benjamin Net Worth: Music Career and Lifestyle</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./fisk-season-3-cast-plot-and-more.html>Fisk Season 3: Cast, Plot, and More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./fisk-season-3-cast-plot-and-more.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
