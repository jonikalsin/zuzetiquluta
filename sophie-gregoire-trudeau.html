They are mostly in the provinces of British Columbia, Ontario, Alberta, Quebec, and Manitoba. Additionally, there was one death linked to the disease. To deal with this, Canada announced on Wednesday a C$1bn ($728m; £562m) coronavirus response fund to deal with the pandemic.</p><p>The funding package aimed to help the country address the domestic impact of the virus and to support further research, including vaccine development. Mr. Trudeau also said that his government was ready to do more if the situation warranted it. In addition, speaking to reporters on Wednesday, the prime minister also urged Canadians to follow the recommendations of public health officials to help slow the spread of the disease and also to avoid putting an overburden on the health care system.</p><h2><span id=Sophie_Gregoire_Trudeau_8211_Early_Life_and_Childhood>Sophie Grégoire Trudeau – Early Life and Childhood</span></h2><p>Sophie Grégoire Trudeau was born on <strong>24 April 1975</strong>, in Montreal, Quebec. And is currently <strong>48 years old</strong>. She is the only child of parents Jean Grégoire and Estelle Blais. Jean is a stockbroker while Estelle Blais is a Franco-Ontarian nurse.

She credits therapy, the support of her loved ones, and yoga with her recovery from the illness.</p><p>Regarding her education, she attended high school at the private Pensionnat du Saint-Nom-de-Marie in Outremont. She then attended the Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf before studying commerce at McGill University. Also, she intended to follow her father’s career path, but soon, she switched to communications.

She was later promoted to account manager. However, after three years of working in advertising, public relations, and sales, she decided to attend radio and television school, where she immediately knew, “I had found my calling”.</p><p>After completing her studies there, Grégoire got a job in a newsroom, writing the news ticker.

However, the Toronto Star pop music critic Ben Rayner said the song was “out of pitch” and “cast serious doubt upon her musical judgment”.
