It’s clear the couple have a very special bond, and support each other in all they do. Find out everything you need to know about Steve and his relationship with Tamron here.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/tamron-halls-husband-steve-greener-5-things-to-know-ss-embed.jpg><h2>How did Tamron meet Steve?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Tamron revealed that she had known the man she eventually married “for many years” in an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>,&nbsp;but she later admitted that Steve is “shy” and it “wasn’t clear” when he was hitting on her, but once they started dating, it was an amazing match. She first revealed that she was dating a man who worked in “entertainment” in an interview on&nbsp;The Steve Harvey Show&nbsp;in 2017, but they knew each other for some time.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Tamron explained that having some time apart from her job helped her realize how special Steve was. “When we finally started dating, I could see him clearly. When I was working, given the competitive environment I was in, you don’t always see people for who they are,” she told People. “Once I left, I started to have better conversations. You’re more present, and you’re not looking at your phone, not checking your email. The fear factor of ‘What’s going on with my spot? Am I going to keep this job?’ fell away, and I could really see Steven.”</p><h2>Steve is a talent manager in the music industry</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Steve became the head of the music talent management division at Primary Wave Entertainment in 2017, per&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety</a>.&nbsp;Some of the artists that he manages with the company are&nbsp;<strong>Melissa Etheridge,&nbsp;</strong>Cypress Hill, Toots & The Maytals, and more, per his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>bio</a>.</p><h2>He was a movie producer</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Before the music industry, Steve worked in a very different side of the entertainment business. He served as a producer on a number of different movies, and was an executive producer on&nbsp;The Bernie Mac Show. In fact, he was a producer for a few different projects that the late&nbsp;<strong>Bernie Mac&nbsp;</strong>starred in, including&nbsp;Mr. 3000, Soul Men,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Guess Who,&nbsp;per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDb</a>.</p><h2>Steve and Tamron have one child together</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>The same year that Steve and Tarmon got married, they also announced that the talk show <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>host was pregnant</a> with their son&nbsp;<strong>Moses,&nbsp;</strong>now 3, via IVF in a 2019 <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> post. While she now regularly shares adorable photos of her son, Tamron had kept her pregnancy a secret for some time. She later explained the decision in <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a 2021 interview</a> with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>.&nbsp;“I said to my team that this was my journey and I didn’t want to cede that to others,” she explained.</p><h2>What have they said about one another?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>While they mostly keep their relationship out of the spotlight, the pair have occasionally opened up about their love for one another in interviews. Tamron has spoken about how her hubby is her biggest supporter. “He’s an outgoing person. He’s a shy person, but he likes to stay, not in the shadows, but he likes to stay on the side and he likes to root me on,” she told&nbsp;People&nbsp;in the aforementioned interview.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>In that same interview, Steve has also gushed about his wife and how happy he is to have a family with her. “My favorite part of marriage and fatherhood so far is realizing every day I am exactly where I was always meant to be — with my family. I am home,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9OapKunnmK1orjLZp%2Buq5KWu6V5lGlsanBla3w%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftamron-hall-husband-5051856.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftamron-hall-husband-5051856.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftamron-hall-husband-5051856.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftamron-hall-husband-5051856.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftamron-hall-husband-5051856.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftamron-hall-husband-5051856.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./samantha-woll-husband.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./samantha-woll-husband.html>Samantha Woll Husband, Was She Married?
