Let's delve into the captivating and controversial career of the enigmatic Iron Mike.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Unprecedented Success in the Ring</h2><p>It seemed like nothing could ever slow down the multiple heavyweight champion and at the time, various defining moments were etched into the fabric of Tyson's esteemed career that had never been seen before. In 1986, he became the youngest heavyweight champion in history when he knocked out Trevor Berbick at 20 years of age. He then unified the WBA, WBC, and IBF belts reinforcing his reputation as one of the sport's greatest knockout specialists.</p><h2>Controversies and Legal Issues</h2><p>Although he enjoyed great success as a prizefighter, Tyson also made headlines for controversies and run-ins with the law that sometimes seemed to overshadow what he did in the ring. It became one of his most infamous scandals behind his being convicted and jailed for rape in 1992, serving 3 years at the Indiana Youth Center. Not helping his reputation as a sportsperson was his infamous 1997 bout with Evander Holyfield in Las Vegas when he bit off a chunk of Holyfield's ear.</p><h2><br>Post-Retirement Struggles</h2><p>After retiring in 2005, Tyson's life remained a roller-coaster. The siren song of a $13 million back tax bill lured him back into the ring in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and he faded quickly - still, few fights felt as big as a Tyson fight. The latter half of his career was marked by erratic and pugnacious behavior (for which he was later charged with common assault), road rage assaults, and convictions for assaulting prostitutes, as well as increasingly eccentric and insensitively provocative public statements.</p><h2><br>Redemption and Legacy</h2><p>Tyson himself tried to turn his life around by returning to the ring and winning some quick victories over easy opposition while also making other attempts to bring more order to his life. The controversies aside, Tyson is still an icon in the world of boxing. Exhibition matches followed, and in 2011 he was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame as part of his post-boxing legacy.</p><h2><br>Career Stats & Achievements</h2><p>Tyson fought 58 times throughout his professional boxing career, finishing with an official record of 50 wins and six losses, with two no-contests. Exactly 44 of those wins came by way of knockout. Putting his incredible success in the squared circle to the side, his controversial personal conduct ranks him as one of Boxing's most divisive but, equally, most important of characters.</p><h2><br>In the End</h2><p>Throughout his career, Mike Tyson's intriguing life story has been laced with triumphs and controversies, moments of brilliance in the ring, and considerable trouble outside of the ring. His life may have been always changing but how he impacted the sport of boxing is undeniable. He is no longer a sports figure, not only because he still churns out headlines with his boxing ventures and off-the-ring ventures, but also because of his presence in the world.&nbsp;<br>Ultimately, the story of Mike Tyson's career is a study of the human dichotomy, the struggle for greatness, and the eternal pull of redemption.&nbsp;</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0miZqLCZo7Rww8eyZKKrXaK2rLGMrbCsp55iwLB5wqilraqfq7Kzv8iaow%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-is-mike-tyson-so-controversial.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-is-mike-tyson-so-controversial.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-is-mike-tyson-so-controversial.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-is-mike-tyson-so-controversial.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-is-mike-tyson-so-controversial.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-is-mike-tyson-so-controversial.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./fritz-mulhausen-obituary-mokena-illinois-fritz-mulhausen-has-died.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./fritz-mulhausen-obituary-mokena-illinois-fritz-mulhausen-has-died.html>Fritz Mulhausen Obituary, Mokena Illinois, Fritz Mulhausen Has Died</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-are-items-on-gerry-turner-and-theresa-nists-wedding-registry-the-golden-bachelor-couple-asks-for-coffee-maker-and-smart-tv.html>What are items on Gerry Turner and Theresa Nist's wedding registry?
